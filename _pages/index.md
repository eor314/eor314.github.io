I develop and apply machine learning techniques, informed by (mostly marine) ecological questions and engineering constraints, to facilitate observing systems that address long-standing scientific questions with societal relevance. I lead the AI team at the UK National Oceanography Centre where we work on problems ranging from decision making on autonomus systems to developing new approaches for analyzing global-scale model output.
